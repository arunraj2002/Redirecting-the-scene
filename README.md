# Redirecting the scene

## Aim:
To Redirecting the scene in the unity engine.

## Algorithm:
### Step 1:
To open the unity engine.

### Step 2:
Create a new plane and create a cube and give color for the cube.

### Step 3:
Next create sphere in the orgin and change the z-axis and Give the color for the sphere.

### Step 4:
Create a tag for the Sphere and Make the sphere and cube as a Rigidbodies and Make the sphere use Gravity.

### Step 5:
Create the C# script file in the Assets and write the Coding for the Redirecting to the page2 after hit the sphere to cube.

### Step 6:
Next Create a another new scene named as page2.

### Step 7
In File->Build settings and drop the both first scene and page2 scene in the Scenes in build setting.

### Step 8:
Click the Build and run button in the Build settings and run the scene.

### Step 9:
The Sphere after touching the cube it will disappeared and Press the key [R] the redircting to the new scene that is page2.
## Program:
```c#
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    Rigidbody rb;
    public GameObject WinText;

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        if(Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.R))
        {
            SceneManager.LoadScene("Page2");
        }

    }
    private void OnMouseDown()
    {
        Destroy(gameObject);

    }
    private void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)
    {
        if(collision.gameObject.tag=="Sphere")
        {
          Destroy(collision.gameObject);
            WinText.SetActive(true);
        }
    }
}
```
## Output:
### After the Ball hit the cube:

## Result:

Thus the above C# coding is successfully redirecting the scene in the unity engine.
